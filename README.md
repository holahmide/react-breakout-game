# A Fun Breakout game!

> I wanted to understand the concept of HTML Canvas and how to take advantages of its features to make video games even on the web! Its quite fun with react hooks & context. ðŸ˜Ž.

## To use

```bash
git clone ... breakout-game
cd breakout-game
yarn
yarn dev
```

## Need for Improvement

<ol>
  <li>Currently the player/paddle can only be moved with the arrow keys, change to <b>mouseover</b> event.</li>
  <li>Make it multi-level by increasing the number of blocks rows after the user has cleared all blocks.</li>
</ol>
